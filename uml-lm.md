## What is UML?

-  UML is a **visual notation system** which can be used to design software
-  It was first devised in **1996** by Booch, Jacobson and Rumbaugh  
-  The goal was to **unify/standardise** all the various modelling languages and diagrams used in Software Development
-  In **2005**, ISO published UML as an **international standard**
-  **UML 2.0** is the most current version, there are currently **14 different diagram types**

## Why use UML?

-   UML offers us a **standardised way of designing** software
-   It allows us to **think through our systems** before committing them to code
-   It offers a **shared language** between programmer and other disciplines including **clients**

## Diagram Families

Uml can be divided into 2 types:

**Behaviour Diagrams**
– Describes what happens in a system, this includes interactions between users and the system
– Or the current system and other external systems

**Structure Diagrams**
– Describes what is contained in the system
– Typically used to model the system
