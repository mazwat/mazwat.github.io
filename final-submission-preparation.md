You are rapidly approaching your **COMP140 Assignment 1 deadline**. I have prepared this information to support your submission and help you prepare the resources you need to submit.

## Submission Criteria

First and foremost, if you want to achieve a good grade it is vital you pay attention to the key criteria in the rubric which is at the bottom of the **[brief](https://learningspace.falmouth.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=228190)** for Assignment 2.

In summary here they are:

|Criteria |Weight |
|--|--|
|Basic Competency Threshold  | 30% |
|Sophistication of Code| 15% |
|Maintainability of Code| 10% |
|Functionality of Physical Prototype| 5% |
|Physical Form Factor Sophistication| 10% |
|Creative Response to Brief| 10% |
|Use of Version Control| 10% |

Ensure that you have given each criteria your consideration when designing your project. This assignment constitutes **70%** of your grade.

## Contracts

We will be assessing you on how well you have met the requirements of the **[contract](https://learningspace.falmouth.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=228876)**. Does your experience meet the needs of your specific client. This will effect how we appraise all of the above criteria.

## Deliverable Elements

You are required to submit a number of specific components to complete the assignment. They are:

### A Repo
You must submit a **link to a repo** that is fullly documented. We expect you to provide a readme.md that explains the function and purpose of the repo. You should imagine that the project contained within is going to be **used by a third-party**. In which case you should make it clear how to use it and to **recreate** your experience.

There are some essential elements that should be included **in the repo**:

 1. A **video** - showing your game/experience/robot functioning as intended. It should show your control system, any enclosures and your UI or interface. A person should be seen to be using/playing the project.
 2. **5 images** - these should show the electronics,wiring, CAD designs and the enclosure and game screens (if you have them)
 3. **Unity project** - (if your project requires a game or GUI element).
 4. **Arduino files** - .ino and any other libraries - .cpp and Header files (if used).
 5. **CAD files** - If your enclosure required the use of Fusion or a similar CAD application include images/files in your repo.
 6. **Readme.md** - as mentioned previously include detailed documentation.
 7. **Licencing/Copyright** - if you are using any third-party assets or libraries please provide details of the licences and include comments in your code where you have made use of third-party libraries and methods. Your repo should also have it's own licence attached.
 8. **Code quality** - We expect code to be easily accessible and well commented. Relationships between object and classess should be explicit.

## Peer Review

Please be aware that a peer review will take place **next week (monday).** Your project should be in a form for your peers to review it and provide appraisal to support you when you submit your final work. Ideally you should have a **functioning prototype** and a **well formed repo** at this stage.

If you still have questions about your upcoming submissions please don't hesitate to ask me.
