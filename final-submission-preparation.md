You are rapidly approaching your COMP140 Assignment 1 deadline. I have prepared this information to support your submission and help you prepare the resources you need to submit.

## Submission Criteria

First and foremest, if you want to achieve a good grade it is vital you pay attention to the key criteria in the rubric which is at the bottom of the **[brief](https://learningspace.falmouth.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=228190)** for Assignment 2.

In summary here they are:

|Criteria |Weight |
|--|--|
|Basic Competency Threshold  | 30% |
|Sophistication of Code| 15% |
|Maintainability of Code| 10% |
|Functionality of Physical Prototype| 5% |
|Physical Form Factor Sophistication| 10% |
|Creative Response to Brief| 10% |
|Use of Version Control| 10% |

Ensure that you have given each criteria your consideration when designing your project.

## Contracts

There are some essential elements that should be included:

 1. A **video** showing your game/experiecne/robot functioning as intended. It should show your control system, any enclosures and your UI or interface. A person should be seen to be using/playing the project.
 2. **5 images** than show the electronics,wiring and the enclosure and game screens (if you have them)
 3. A **Unity project** (if your project requites a game or GUI element).
 4. **Arduino files** - .ino and any other libraries - .cpp and Header files (if used).
 5. CAD files. If you enclsoure required the use o
