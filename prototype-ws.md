This week is your opportunity to start developing your individual creative computing project.

Focus on the most difficult aspects of your build:

-   Ordering the relevant electronics, sensors, and modules you need. If you still have questions about components ask me, Andy or your programming tutor.
-   Do a rough test of your control system. Wire it up using Arduino/Uduino/Unity. Does it work?
-   Does it interact with your Unity (or other) interface as expected? Move some game objects around using some digital or analogue input
-   Is the data mapping correctly?
-   Do virtual components react in a way that feels meaningful as you manipulate your control system?
-   What does the user experience feel like?
-   If the feel isn't right, consider what needs to be done to improve the interface.

ACTIVITY

  

**Build a basic prototype**

You should be building on the foundations of your programming skills. After you have developed your proposal and UML diagrams you should create a prototype that demonstrates these elements:

  

1.  A control system - you can input values into your game/experience from some custom control system composed of sensors that responds to user actions.
2.  An interface - your inputs are reflected as outputs to the screen or to some other output.
3.  Feedback - a user should be able to receive ongoing feedback as a result of their actions.
4.  Update your diagrams as your system adapts to the results of your research.

  

In week 7 we will be expecting to see a basic prototype in your seminar groups.
