# Electrical Circuits

The following materials are derived from the *Electrical Circuits lecture*. The video lecture is included at the bottom of the [document](#video-lecture).

In this lecture we will look at Electrical Circuits and the basics of making  in subsequent lectures we will explore the other elements of the workflow.

## What is electrical current?

Consider a copper wire: matter filled with countless copper atoms. (click) A free electron is floating in a space between atoms, it's pulled and prodded by surrounding charges in that space. In this chaos the free electron eventually finds a new atom to latch on to; in doing so, the negative charge of that electron ejects another electron from the atom. Now a new electron is drifting through free space looking to do the same thing.(click) This chain effect can continue on and on to create a flow of electrons called electric current.

In a circuit we have a flow of electrons through a closed circuit for instance a wire or another components, that is induced by an electric field (battery).
