# Electrical Circuits

The following materials are derived from the *Electrical Circuits lecture*. The video lecture is included at the bottom of the [document](#video-lecture).

In this lecture we will look at Electrical Circuits and the basics of making  in subsequent lectures we will explore the other elements of the workflow.

## What is electrical current?

Consider a copper wire: matter filled with countless copper atoms. A free electron is floating in a space between atoms, it's pulled and prodded by surrounding charges in that space. In this chaos the free electron eventually finds a new atom to latch on to; in doing so, the negative charge of that electron ejects another electron from the atom. Now a new electron is drifting through free space looking to do the same thing. This chain effect can continue on and on to create a flow of electrons called electric current.

In a circuit we have a flow of electrons through a closed circuit for instance a wire or another components, that is induced by an electric field (battery).



It is often assumed that electrons flow from the positive end of an electrical field but in fact they flow from the negative end (click). In the second example (click) we can see how a simple switch can be used to control the flow of electrons in a circuit.

## The Basic Characteristics of Electricity

-   **Voltage (V)** - The relative level of electrical energy between any two points in a circuit. Voltage is measured in Volts(V).
-   **Current (I)** - The amount of electrical energy passing through any point in a circuit. Current is measured in Amps(A).
-   **Resistance (R)** - The amount that any component in the circuit resists the flow of current. Resistance is measured in Ohms(Ω).





Like water electricity needs something to drive it and it’s energy is subject to decay over time. THe electrical field generated by the battery (1) acts as a pump to drive electrons round the circuit, like a pump in domestic water system. A resistor is like a (2) an upper tank that effectively creates pressure in the system allowing the electrons to flow faster. A bulb or any component that is drawing power for a purpose, this is also known as a load on the system (3), is like a water wheel or a turbine that is drawing energy but at the same time is dissipating it, (4) and then the cycle begins again, with the depleted electrons returning to the battery or pump to be released again with charge.
