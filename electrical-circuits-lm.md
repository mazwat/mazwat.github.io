# Electrical Circuits

The following materials are derived from the *Electrical Circuits lecture*. The video lecture is included at the bottom of the [document](#video-lecture).
{: .callout .callout--warning}

In this lecture we will look at Electrical Circuits and the basics of making  in subsequent lectures we will explore the other elements of the workflow.

## What is electrical current?

Consider a copper wire: matter filled with countless copper atoms. A free electron is floating in a space between atoms, it's pulled and prodded by surrounding charges in that space. In this chaos the free electron eventually finds a new atom to latch on to; in doing so, the negative charge of that electron ejects another electron from the atom. Now a new electron is drifting through free space looking to do the same thing. This chain effect can continue on and on to create a flow of electrons called electric current.

*Fig. 1 - Animation showing the flow of electrons*

In a circuit we have a flow of electrons through a closed circuit for instance a wire or another components, that is induced by an electric field (battery).

It is often assumed that electrons flow from the positive end of an electrical field but in fact they flow from the negative end (see Fig.2). We can see how a simple switch can be used to control the flow of electrons in a circuit.

## The Basic Characteristics of Electricity

-   **Voltage (V)** - The relative level of electrical energy between any two points in a circuit. Voltage is measured in Volts(V).
-   **Current (I)** - The amount of electrical energy passing through any point in a circuit. Current is measured in Amps(A).
-   **Resistance (R)** - The amount that any component in the circuit resists the flow of current. Resistance is measured in Ohms(Ω).

*Fig. 3 - Water Analogy*


Like water electricity needs something to drive it and it’s energy is subject to decay over time. The electrical field generated by the battery (1) acts as a pump to drive electrons round the circuit, like a pump in domestic water system. A resistor is like a (2) an upper tank that effectively creates pressure in the system allowing the electrons to flow faster. A bulb or any component that is drawing power for a purpose, this is also known as a load on the system (3), is like a water wheel or a turbine that is drawing energy but at the same time is dissipating it, (4) and then the cycle begins again, with the depleted electrons returning to the battery or pump to be released again with charge.

*Fig. 4 - Water Analogy - Voltage, Current and Resistance*

In this second analogy we can imagine voltage as the head of water in the system creating the pressure. meanwhile the Amps (click) are the amount of energy passing a particular point. The wider the pipe the more energy can flow at one time, but it will also lose power quicker. Resistance (click) is another method to increase the pressure but slow down the flow, this is why resistors are used to control the amount of electrons reaching a component or load. Specifically to stop that component burning out.

## Learning to Read Schematics

Here you can see the simple diagram from earlier being interpreted into a schematic. Each elements has a specific symbol in the circuit and it has text notation to define type and value. In this example I am replacing the light bulb (as seen in the drawing) with an LED as this is what we will be using in our Arduino circuits.

Wiring quickly becomes chaotic and complex and unlike a purely digital project if you make a mistake you can’t control Z or restore a previous version so having a good schematic or diagram is vital to keep track of you set-up as you develop your project.

## Components & Schematics

### Component Types

As you start to develop your own custom circuits you will become familiar with these common components and how to use them. Each component has a corresponding symbol on a schematic.

![Components](images/components.png)
*Fig. 7 - Some Commonly used components*

- **Resistors** - are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, and to divide voltages
- **LED's** - are a semiconductor that emits light when current flows through it.
- **Diodes** - conduct electricity easily in one direction, and stops flow in the other direction.
- **Switches** - are an electrical component that can disconnect or connect the conducting path in an Electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another.
- **Transistors** - is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power.
- **Jumper Leads** -  are easy pluggable cables that act as the wire between components in bread board setups. We will look at bread boards in more detail in a future lecture.

###  Schematics

Here are some rule when putting together a schematic. We will look at some basic examples in the following section.

-   Positive voltages are uppermost
-   Things happen left to right
-   All components have a name and values
-   Remember symbols
-   Dots show that the wires are connected
-   Nets: Inferred connection based on symbol or name

All components have their corresponding symbol in a circuit diagram.

*Fig. 8 - Components as schematic symbols*

If you want to experiment with putting schematics together you can make a start by looking at the diagram above and making your own account here: **[circuit-diagram.org](https://crcit.net/c/82ffa9aa0f564eabaf0fea65de580e14)**. You will become more familiar with using them as the module progresses.

## Ohms Law

<span class="katex">voltage(v) = current(I)*resistance(R)</span>

**Ohm's law**  states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. To be able to make meaningful statements about these quantities in circuits, we need to be able to describe their quantities in the same way that we might quantify mass, temperature, volume, length, or any other kind of physical quantity. For mass, we might use the units of “kilogram” or “gram.”
