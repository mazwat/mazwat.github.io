## Purpose of a Poster

Posters are widely used in the **academic community**, and most conferences include poster presentations in their program. Research posters **summarise** information or research concisely and attractively to help **publicise** it and generate **discussion**.

The poster is usually a mixture of a **brief text** mixed with **tables**, **graphs**, **pictures**, and other presentation formats. At a conference, the researcher stands by the poster display while other participants can come and view the presentation and **interact** with the **author.**

## What makes good poster content

-   Important information should be **readable** from about **10 feet** away
-   **Title** is **short** and draws interest
-   Word count of about **300 to 800 words**
-   Text is **clear** and **to the point**
-   Use of **bullets**, **numbering**, and **headlines** make it easy to read
-   Effective use of **graphics**, **colour** and **fonts**
-   **Consistent** and **clean** layout
-   Includes **acknowledgments**, your **name** and **institutional** affiliation
-   **References** to main areas of research

## Brief Requirements Summary

 1. Detail the hardware of the control system
