# Develop your Project Proposal

Welcome to Week 2 of COMP140. This week we want you to consolidate the research from the previous week and develop your own response to the brief in Assignment 1.  What do you want to create as a custom control system? What game or experience do you want to control?

  

**Task**

Write a **1 page proposal** for a novel game/experience and control system:  

-   Describe the game design that will form the basis for your interface
-   illustrate basic research into electronic component and physical form factors for controllers
-   analyse the design of the controller in detail
-   list the key electronic components of your controller
-   and list the key user stories*.
