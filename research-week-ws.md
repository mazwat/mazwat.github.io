# Research Week - Consolidation

This week is a consolidation of your skills in programming and Arduino. Please expand on the exercise you began last week to complete a design document and a simple level of a prototype game.

  

EXERCISE

**Design A Basic Mario Platformer**

Based on your insight into SOLID with specific reference to: Single Responsibility Principle, Open Closed Principle and Liskov Substitution principle work in teams of 3-5 to design and develop a platformer based on the following image

----


You are not designing Mario, but you are using this as template.

1.  Develop a design specification document for your game. Break down all the key functionality into encapsulated classes. You should design the key classes and relationships that would be in the platformer

2.  We are not expecting you to use any formal notation at this stage but we expect you to  develop a diagram that represents an overview of all the relationships. We will explore the use of UML in a later session but for now try out the basics here at [diagrams.net](http://diagrams.net)

3.  Please think about the classes, variables and functions that will support the game

4.  Develop a basic prototype of your game (one level) in Unity that uses the specification outlined in the document.

5.  Your game should employ the class structure and hierarchy from your document.
6.  Use the following assets (see below) in your game - [Kenney Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets?s=platformer)

7.  Deliverables for week 5 workshop:
	- A **document** that plots the relationship between your classes
	- You should bring a **working game in Unity to the workshop** where you can demonstrate the construction of your classes and objects in your game to the group.
