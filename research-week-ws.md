# Research Week

This week is a consolidation of your skills in programming and Arduino. Please expand on the exercise you began last week to complete a design document and a simple level of a prototype game.


## Exercise

**Design A Basic Mario Platformer**

Based on your insight into SOLID with specific reference to: Single Responsibility Principle, Open Closed Principle and Liskov Substitution principle work in teams of 3-5 to design and develop a platformer based on the following image

You are not designing Mario, but you are using this as template.

1.  Develop a **design specification document** for your game. Break down all the key functionality into encapsulated classes. You should design the key classes and relationships that would be in the platformer:
2. 
	- We are not expecting you to use any formal notation at this stage but we expect you to create a diagram that represents an overview of all the relationships. 
	
We will explore the use of UML in a later session but for now try out the basics here at [diagrams.net](http://diagrams.net)
{: .callout .callout--info}Think about the classes, variables and functions that will support the game

3.  Develop a basic prototype of your game (one level) in Unity that uses the specification outlined in the document.
	- Your game should employ the class structure and hierarchy from your document.
	- Use the following assets (see below) in your game - [Kenney Assets](https://kenney.nl/assets?s=platformer)

5.  Deliverables for week 5 workshop:
	- A **document** that plots the relationship between your classes
	- You should bring a **working game in Unity to the workshop** where you can demonstrate the construction of your classes and objects in your game to the group.
