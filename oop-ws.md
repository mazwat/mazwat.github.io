# Object Oriented Programming

This workshop is divided into to 2 parts where we will explore the use of code in Visual Studio and Unity. Complete each task in your own time. We will review solutions at the halfway point.

## PART 1 - Using OOP in **Visual Studio**
### Exercise 1

![Add Console App](images/create-console.png)

Create a console app project in VISUAL STUDIO
1. Create a C# program that requests 5 names of ``Dog`` from the user and stores them in an array of objects of type ``Dog``. To do this, first create a dog class that has a name member variable of type ``string``.
2. Your input should be: ``Labrador, Poodle, Wolf, Fox, Pug.`` 
3. Your output should be: 

```
A pack of wild dogs emerged out of the wilderness. 
Amongst their number was:
A Labrador
A Poodle
A Wolf
A Fox
A Pug
```
You should use a loop to iterate through the array. Your Dog class needs a method to return the value of name. 
You should use ``console.ReadLine`` to input the value.
{: .callout .callout--info}

### Exercise 2

1. Expanding on the previous exercise. Create 2 new classes called Wild and Domestic. 
2. Once again use the loop to iterate output values.
3. Use inheritance to inherit the parent class filed name. Your should also have a new property called Behaviour which contains the behaviour of each class of dog. It should be both readable and writable.
4. Output should be something like this:
```
The Labrador wags its tail!
The Poodle Wags its tail!
and so onâ€¦
```
