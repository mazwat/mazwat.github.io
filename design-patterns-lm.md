The following materials are derived from the *Design Patterns lecture*. The video lecture is included at the bottom of the [*document*](#video-lecture).

## Introduction

Design patterns was written in 1994 by the ‘Gang of Four’ - Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Richard Helm &  Ralph Johnson. Design patterns are set of procedures or patterns that help to make OOP code more effective and reusable.

Design patterns establish consistency that helps developers build and modify code safely avoiding common architecting problems. 

- Using consistent methods to fix and to avoid issues. 
- Having a shared language to understand common problems
- Adhering to the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming.

### Object Oriented Design Basics

Design Patterns are intended for object orientated systems as they tend to exhibit recurring structures that promote:

-   **Abstraction**
-   **Flexibility**
-   **Modularity**
-   **Elegance**

Abstracts a recurring design structure and comprises class and/or object:

-   **dependencies**
-   **structures**
-   **interactions**
-   **conventions**

Names and specifies the design structure explicitly and thereby distils design experience

### Formalising the Relationship between Objects

Design patterns have some basic similarities there is almost always a **client** that requests something or makes use of the pattern. There is also a **subject** that is usually creating, producing, changing, observing or providing access to the object which is usually an **product** in the system or a game object on screen.
