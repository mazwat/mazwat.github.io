# Data Structures

-   In programming we have the concept of reusable data structures which can be used to build applications
-   These can be used in order to build larger systems (e.g. Inventory Systems, AI Navigation etc)
-   Most programming languages have these built in
-   Before writing any system you should always examine these data structures and pick the appropriate one for your Use Case

## Big 'O" Notation

“Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.”
Bill Gates
