# Introduction

***ROB210 is intended to apply robotics and cybernetics principles to the design and development of simple robot prototypes.***

“Cybernetics” comes from a Greek word ***kybernetes*** meaning the "the art of steering". Cybernetics is a philosophy of technology that describes how automatic control systems operate in both machines and the natural world. Cybernetics is concerned with defining a goal and taking action to achieve that goal. Knowing whether you have reached your goal (or at least are getting closer to it) requires “feedback”. Feedback is explored extensively by the principles of cybernetics.

The following materials are supporting documentation and resources for the module.
