1. Define its key elements
2. Design a poster in MURAL that explains the patterns key features:
3. Define the purpose and use case of the pattern
4. Explain its principle classes, interfaces and implementations
5. Use Code Examples

## EXERCISE 2
### Implement a design pattern in code

1. Using the design pattern you researched, implement an example that uses Unity and changes or alters game objects in some way.
2. Demonstrate your approach with well structured and commented code.
3. Be prepared to explain how this solves a key problem.
4. You can apply it to your own Individual game project if this gives you a problem that the pattern may solve,
5. You can make use of code samples but please demonstrate how you customised the example to meet your own needs.
