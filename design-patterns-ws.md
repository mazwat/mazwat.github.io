# Design Patterns

{: .callout .callout--warning}

You will be assigned a specific pattern in pairs in todays session. ONce you have a pattern to research 

## EXERCISE 2
### Research and Implement a design pattern in code

1. Define its key elements and research how it is implemented
2. **Fork** this [repo](https://github.falmouth.ac.uk/Matt-Watkins/COMP140-Design-Patterns) and add a folder referring to pattern you are researching. I have put an example repo of the Observer pattern that contains a unity project and a readme
3. Create a repo and use the **readme.md** to explains the patterns key features.
	3. Define the purpose and use case of the pattern
	4. Explain its principle classes, interfaces and implementations
4. Using the design pattern you researched, implement an example that uses Unity and changes or alters game objects in some way.
5. Demonstrate your approach with well structured and commented code.
6. Be prepared to explain how this solves a key problem.
7. You can apply it to your own Individual game project if this gives you a problem that the pattern may solve,
8. You can make use of existing code samples but please demonstrate how you customised the example to meet your own needs.
