# Design Patterns

Note - Please **don't start the exercises** below until the begining of mondays workshop as the task will be done in groups.
{: .callout .callout--info}

You will be assigned a specific pattern in pairs in todays session. ONce you have a pattern to research 

## EXERCISE 2
### Research and Implement a design pattern in code

1. Define its key elements and research how it is implemented
2. **Fork** this [repo](https://github.falmouth.ac.uk/Matt-Watkins/COMP140-Design-Patterns) and add a folder referring to pattern you are researching. I have put an example repo of the Observer pattern that contains a unity project and a readme as an indicative approach.
3. In your repo use the **readme.md** to explains the patterns key features.
	3. Define the purpose and use case of the pattern
	4. Explain its principle **classes, interfaces and implementations**
4. Using the design pattern you researched, **implement an example** that uses **Unity** and changes or alters **game objects** in some way.
5. Demonstrate your approach with **well structured and commented code**.
6. Be prepared to explain how this **solves a key problem**.
7. You can make use of existing code samples but please demonstrate how you customised the example to meet your own needs.


## Rest of the Week

7. Demonstrate a design pattern in your own Individual game project if this gives you a problem that the pattern may solve.
8. 


## LECTURE

It is assumed that you have watched the video lecture and viewedd the [materials](design-patterns-lm) before this workshop. If not you should find time to watch them during the week.
