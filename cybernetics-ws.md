# States & Transistions

This week your primary focus for the workshop should be on your project and your specific needs and requirements.

The theme for the week is intended as supporting material for the development of your final product. One of the key elements of the lecture was implementing finite state machines.

## Finite State Machines

One of the key areas where realtime applications fall down whether it's a computer game or an automous robot is handling the concurrent states and transitions. It's vital to identify different states in the system:

 - Button ON
 - Button OFF
 - Character IDLE
 - Motor FORWARD
 - Motor REVERSE
 - Led BLINKING
 - Note DURATION
 - Enemy IN RANGE

There are numerous states in a system and often these are monitored in relatively naive ways. Using an if statement or switches nested in an update or a loop. We may still deploy these to detect thresh
