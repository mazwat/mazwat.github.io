# Unified Modelling Language

This week you should be thinking about the different parts of your experience and how it will
interact with the user/player. UML is a useful method to breakdown all the key part of your
project from the high level interactions of the user with the features of your system, to the order
of events and all the way down to the fundamental relationship of classes and objects within your
code.
Creating diagrams can feel secondary to the main priority of building something, but they play an
essential role in defining the core structure and allowing you and team members to share key
elements. In physical computing the sequence and order of events can play a critical part in how
or whether something works as expected.


## EXERCISE 1
### UML Diagrams – Mario Platformer Group Project

For this exercise you should create a comprehensive **UML Class diagram** to document the design
of your group project. You maybe doing this retrospectively but it gives you an opportunity to
reflect on the formal structure you made in developing your game.

## EXERCISE 2
### UML Diagrams for Individual Creative Computing Project

For this exercise you should use the appropriate UML Diagrams to create an initial design of your
game and control system. Based on these 5 types of diagram: **Use Case, Activity, State, Sequence**
and **Class**. Please note this will form part of Assignment 2, so please keep a copy of the diagrams
you create.

Points to consider:
- What diagram can be used to document the high-level usage of the system?
- What diagram can be used to model the user’s interaction with the physical control system?
- What diagram can be used to model the systems inside the experience or game?

You should develop at least **3 diagrams** and one of them should be a Class diagram

## LECTURE

It is assumed that you have watched the video lecture before this workshop or read the [materials](uml-lm). If not you should find time to watch it during the week.
