# Unified Modelling Language

#### **UML** is a useful method to breakdown all the key parts of your project from the high level **interactions** of the **user** with the **features** of your **system**, to the **order** of **events** and all the way down to the fundamental relationship of **classes** and **objects** within your **algorithms**.

This week you should be thinking about the different parts of your experience and how it will
interact with the user/player. UML is a useful method to breakdown all the key part of your
project from the high level interactions of the user with the features of your system, to the order of events and all the way down to the fundamental relationship of classes and objects within your code.

Creating diagrams can feel secondary to the main priority of building something, but they play an essential role in defining the core structure and allowing you and team members to share key elements. In physical computing the sequence and order of events can play a critical part in how or whether something works as expected.


## 1. Recap and Work Sharing
### Mario Platformer using SOLID - Group Project

Share your group game and assess how well it meets the criteria.
You can do this by undergoing a Feedback Fruits Peer Review at this link:

## 2. UML Diagramming
### UML Diagrams for Individual Creative Computing Project

### Pair Work
You will be working in pairs to complete this task.
Find your pair here: [https://www.keamk.com/ncnz3p9r6vdqcls1](https://www.keamk.com/ncnz3p9r6vdqcls1)

You will create **a UML diagram** of the **type** outlined in option below. You can choose to do any  that is of interest to you, but consider it's application to your subject area.


## Create UML in LaTeX

Create your diagrams using. LaTeX and Overleaf. You can script your UML diagrams using the **TikZ-UML package** You can read about it here in the documentation:
 [https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~kielbasi/tikzuml/var/files/doc/tikzumlmanual.pdf](https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~kielbasi/tikzuml/var/files/doc/tikzumlmanual.pdf)
 
 I have also supplied a **Starter Overleaf template** as a starting point to begin creating diagrams programmatically:

## Choose an option for your diagram

### 1.  USE CASE Diagram for Discord

-   What are the key Use Cases for Discord?
-  Define the high level overview of this popular VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform

### 2.  STATE Diagram for a Robot 

-   Develop a **state diagram** for a Roomba vacuum cleaner robot
-   Remember to consider itâ€™s charging phase alongside it various other states.
- Do your research to understand it's functionality

### 3. ACTIVITY Diagram for  Tetris
 - Consider the flow of bricks
 - How decision are made
 - What are the start and end points of the activity

### 4. SEQUENCE Diagram of Guitar Hero

- Remember to consider the various ways that the actor interacts with the controller and the system.
- Waht the loops and the messaging within the system
