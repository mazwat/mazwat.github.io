# Unified Modelling Language

#### **UML** is a useful method to breakdown all the key parts of your project from the high level **interactions** of the **user** with the **features** of your **system**, to the **order** of **events** and all the way down to the fundamental relationship of **classes** and **objects** within your **algorithms**.

This week you should be thinking about the different parts of your experience and how it will
interact with the user/player. UML is a useful method to breakdown all the key part of your
project from the high level interactions of the user with the features of your system, to the order of events and all the way down to the fundamental relationship of classes and objects within your code.

Creating diagrams can feel secondary to the main priority of building something, but they play an essential role in defining the core structure and allowing you and team members to share key elements. In physical computing the sequence and order of events can play a critical part in how or whether something works as expected.


## 1. Recap and Work Sharing
### Mario Platformer using SOLID - Group Project

Share your group game and assess how well it meets the criteria.
You can do this by undergoing a Feedback Fruits Peer Review at this link:
[https://learningspace.falmouth.ac.uk/mod/lti/view.php?id=233756](https://learningspace.falmouth.ac.uk/mod/lti/view.php?id=233756)

## 2. UML Diagramming
### UML Diagrams for Individual Creative Computing Project

### Pair Work
You will be working in pairs to complete this task.
Find your pair here: [https://www.keamk.com/ncnz3p9r6vdqcls1](https://www.keamk.com/ncnz3p9r6vdqcls1)

You will crreate

Points to consider:
- What diagram can be used to document the high-level usage of the system?
- What diagram can be used to model the user’s interaction with the physical control system?
- What diagram can be used to model the systems inside the experience or game?

You should develop at least **3 diagrams** and one of them should be a Class diagram

## Resources for Creating UML

Create your diagrams using. LaTeX and Overleaf. You can script your UML diagrams using the **TikZ-UML package** You can read about it here in the documentation:
 [https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~kielbasi/tikzuml/var/files/doc/tikzumlmanual.pdf](https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~kielbasi/tikzuml/var/files/doc/tikzumlmanual.pdf)
 
 I have also supplied a **Starter Overleaf template** as a starting point to begin creating diagrams programmatically:

## LECTURE

It is assumed that you have watched the video lecture before this workshop or read the [materials](uml-lm). If not you should find time to watch it during the week.
